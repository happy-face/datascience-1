(2017) that the number of independent phase-space structures sets an intrinsic limiting precision on dynamical inferences based on the steady state assumption. modelling with a radius-independent velocity anisotropy, or using tracers within a limited outer radius, result in significantly larger scatter, but the ensemble-averaged measurement over the whole halo sample is approximately unbiased.",10.1093/mnras/sty706,1/22/2018,3/13/2018,"['wang', 'han', 'cole', 'more', 'frenk', 'schaller']",['physics']
